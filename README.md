# Weather Conditions and Climate Change Predictions with Machine Learning
**Summary:** <br>
ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization, wants to assess available tools for predicting weather in mainland Europe. ClimateWins believes that increases in extreme weather events, like those of the past two decades, could be predicted and planned for using tools such as machine learning. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning

**[Temperature data set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv)**

This project uses a data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Data values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, etc. exist for almost every day. This data is collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set project](https://www.ecad.eu/)
